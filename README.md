## :clipboard:Process 

**1.** Decided on concept ü§®

**2.** Created entity table relationship diagram/schema
![ENT Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/LUEL4P6.png)
--- :one: --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ‚ôæ **MANY** ‚ôæ --- --- --- --- --- --- --- :one: ---

**3.** :notebook: Set up file structure _(note that we have not yet added test files in this diagram)_;

**4.** :mag_right: Searched and found typos _(front and back end)_ and got the server running and all files communicating!

**5.** ‚ùìSet up our testing database ‚ùåüîú‚úÖ
- We first set up local server & then got confused and tried to host a test database on Heroku
- test databases DO NOT need to be hosted on Heroku!

**6.** 

## ü•¥ Problems:

* Working out what our schema relationships were.
* Getting our tests up and running with confidence we weren't about to <span style="color:red;">**ERASE EVERYTHING**</span>!
* Creating the test database. 
    * First we tried to create our test db on Heroku however we could not excute the test script due to errors, we changed tactics and made one locally. 
    * We had missed out the ssl and user keys in the options object within our connection.js file. 
* We also ran into trouble testing the date format as it would print the date,time & time zone.
* Our XMLhtml response request did not return data from our databases
* Linking our databases together to auto populate the FK columns according to primary key (foreign key)
* 


## üí¨ Stretch goals: 

**1.** Multiple upcoming dates. ‚úÖ

**2.** Eventually we will need to filter lunches displayed to only show upcoming dates!

**3.** Carosel form display.

**4.** Votes for upcoming cuisine.
* _(Would involve creating another table.)_

**5.** On form completion, show the lunch you have booked and who is going.

**6.**
